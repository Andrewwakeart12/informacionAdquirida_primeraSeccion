  <style type="text/css">
    /*this is just a comment*/
    .exampleOne{
      color: red;
    }
  </style>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>Comments</h3>
      <p>are code made to explain code so its easy to understand, basically you use something like "/*" and this open the comment and for closing you use "*/"</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Inserting Css</h3>
      <p>there are two options, 1. its just to add css directly in your html document and the 2. its just add an external css document with a link tag, so here's an example:
        <ol>
                  <li class="exampleOne">Document (Style tag)</li>
        <li class="exampleTwo">External Document (Link tag)</li>
        <h4>(its not recommended to use the style tag for a proyect but its avaible if you need it) also have in mind that the inline css its not recommended <tfoot></tfoot></h4>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Syntaxis</h3>
      <p>
        in CSS you'll use a selector to select the element in the DOM (Document Object Model) so you can stylize one (id: #idInCSS) or various elements (class : .classInCSS)with the css (also you can select by the name of the element such a input,h1,etc).

        so a selection in CSS looks like this:

        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>ID:</h3>
            <p>
              #oneElement{
              property: value;
            }
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Class:</h3>
            <p>
              .multipleElements{
              property: value;
            }
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        have in mind that you also can use somethiin like:
        <h3>Tag:</h3>
        input{
              property: value;
      }
      so basically if the selector does'nt have a "#" or "." its just a regular tag so the propertys in there are going to affect only the input tags or the h1 tags, etc.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Colors</h3>
      <p>they come in four maybe five formats and they are:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>HEX (Hexadecimal)</h3>
            <p>this is hexadecimal number that goes from #000000 to #FFFFFF and its defined in that way with number from 0 to 9 and then after 9 from A to F so you have 16 numbers including the 0</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>RGBA (Red, Green, Blue,Alpha)</h3>
            <p>its a scale that goes from 0 to 255 and use the colors Red Green and Blue fot the scale (the alpha its just the opacity)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>HSL (Hue Saturation Light)</h3>
            <p>its the artist method to select color and in html and CSS takes the value in each one of the propertys from 0% to 100%</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Prefab</h3>
            <p>its a gamma of color that CSS have preconfigured so you can use it just saying the color like "red","blue", etc</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        there are more but this 4 are the main color forma  ts
